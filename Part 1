Having started as a developer’s collaborative platform, GitHub is now the largest online storage space of collaborative works that exists in the world.
Massive file dump of human knowledge.

One of the main misconceptions about GitHub is that it is a development tool, a part of the coding environment, just as programming languages and compilers. 

In fact, any kind of document can be shared. 
# In fact we will use github to share files in this class.

Collaborating is not the same thing as cheating.
All rules for not cheating will be strictly enforced in the class.
Only when I tell you to use Github you should actually use it.

#otherwise there will be a penalty.
